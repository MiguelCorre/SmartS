# SmartS
School project that is supposed to simulate a store without cashiers. 
The program creates clients that enter the store, take products of the shelves and leaves the store. When the client leaves the store, the transaction is processed automatically. 
There is a database that stores all the products for sale and it updates whenever a client takes or puts a product on the shelf. We can check the receipts of each individual client, we can check the current stock numbers and also whenever a certain product is running low on numbers, the program automatically "orders" more so it fills back up.
